<p>Designed exclusively for use by business networks.</p>
</br></br>


##Technical Specification
<i>Whatever words we utter should be chosen with care, for people will hear them -- and be influenced by them.</i>

###Introduction
<p>RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> is a secure business messenger for office and remote-user communication that minimises the chance of sensitive and business critical information being released.</p>
<p>RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> differs from other commercial messaging systems, which are largely designed with consumers in mind. By contrast, RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> is designed for business users, with security, flexibility and ease of use as its core philosophical objectives. It is the only messaging
package to be designed exclusively for business.</p>
<p>At LCR Design, we understand that one security failure could mean the leaking of highly sensitive
data to your competitors and, in extreme cases, the destruction of an entire business. We can help
you.</p>

###Product Outline: Specification

###Security
<i>Attacks on your digital security will always seek out the weakest element of your security practices.</i>
-- Surveillance Self-Defence

<p>The RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​messaging service is designed from the ground up as a secure system.
While many consider the RSA cryptography to be close to unassailable, a cipher is only so good as the security of the program that uses it. To this purpose we have researched, evaluated and exhaustively tested every aspect of RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​from a secure-user perspective.</p>

<p><b>Core Principles</b></p>

● CONSIDER POINTS OF ENTRY: A hacker or corporate competitor may gain access to
your system through any server, client or application. A malicious user will then
seek any point of entry through which the program allows data-flow. For this
reason RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​is designed with minimal points of entry; RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​only sends data when you need it to, for the reasons you need it to.

● SIMPLICITY MEANS SECURITY: Simplicity of design means less to test, which in turn
means that we were able to test every aspect of the program exhaustively, in real
business-critical scenarios.

● SECURITY BEGINS WITH THE USER: At each stage in the process we have tested
under business user scenarios, with real business users, to understand and model
user security behaviours.

● NEUTRALISE THREATS EARLY: All program data is available to the sys-admin or
network security manager to view at any time, allowing immediate threat
response.

###Flexibility
<i>The measure of intelligence is the ability to change. -- Albert Einstein</i>

<p>In business flexibility can be the key to succeeding or not, between profit and loss, as a business
either struggles to come to terms with new markets, or embraces the opportunities they bring.
When change needs to occur it needs to occur quickly, easily and without overly costly
restructuring. For this reason, we designed RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​with the ability to grow and change as technology and cultures move forward in new and often unexpected ways.</p>

<p><b>Core Principles</b></p>
● USE ONLY WHAT YOU NEED: Complex code libraries, large feature-sets and layered
front-ends are all the rage at the moment, but when unnecessary, frivolous
features are added they make it much more difficult to extend the program at a
later point, particularly where it needs to interface with new software and
hardware. This is why we only used what we needed for RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b>.

● MAKE IT INTEROPERABLE: RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​is designed to work with all currently
popular operating and networking systems, meaning that you can use RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> for almost any communications task your business might have.

● MAKE IT CUSTOMISABLE: RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> ​has an optional plugin format that
allows new features to be added on the fly without compromising core
functionality or security.

###Ease of Use
<p><i>This is what customers pay us for – to sweat all these details so it’s easy and pleasant for them to
use our computers.</i> -- Steve Jobs</p>

<p><b>Core Principles</b></p>

● EASY TO USE MEANS PRODUCTIVE: Our program is simple, quick and easy to use,
meaning less time spent on training, and troubleshooting, and a more efficient
workforce.

● DESIGN MATTERS: what you choose for your company designs doesn’t just speak
to those outside the business, but also to its employees. The image you project as
a business owner can affect everything from your employee’s well-being, to their
productivity, to their engagement with the business as a whole. For this reason
RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b>​includes multiple pre-set business stylings, as well as the ability
to create and set your own.

● MAKE EVERYTHING ACCESSIBLE: With the RSA-B <i>for</i> <b>Business</b> messenger every
feature is accessible from within two clicks of the main app screen, including all 
out of the box features and settings.
